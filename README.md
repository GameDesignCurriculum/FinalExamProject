# UnityProjectTemplate
Use this template for game projects built in Unity

**NOTE:** This repository template is configured to use LFS for *.blend, *.psd, *.tiff, and *.tif files.   To add additional files to the LFS storage use the command
```
git lfs track
```

## If you have already created your Unity project locally
1. Copy the existing Unity project folder into the cloned repository directory.  It should end up as a folder at the same level as the Art and Design folders, nested within the repository folder.
2. Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file into your **Unity project** folder
3. Rename the moved file to **.gitignore**
4. Go to GitHub Desktop.  Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files)
5. Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of _project name_" and click **Commit**
7. Click **Push** to push the committed changes to GitHub.  _Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository._
8. Continue working locally and committing frequently.  You should **at least** do one COMMIT **and** one PUSH per class period.  More is better!

## If you have NOT created your Unity project locally yet
1. In the Unity Hub, create a new project.  Be sure to set the location for the project as this repository's folder.  This way the new Unity project will be created __inside__ the repository folder, at same level as Art and Design folders.
2. Once the project opens in Unity, go to File Explorer and Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file up into your **Unity project** folder and rename to **.gitignore**
3. Go to GitHub Desktop GUI.  Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files)
4. Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of _project name_" and click **Commit**  _Note: If you may need to close the Unity project. 
5. Click **Push** to push the committed changes to GitHub.  _Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository._
6. Continue working locally and committing frequently.  You should **at least** do one COMMIT **and** one PUSH per day to minimize risk of lost work.
